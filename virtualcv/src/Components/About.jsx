        <p>
          I'm a final-year Information Technology student with a strong
          foundation in software development, databases, and system analysis.
          Passionate about solving real-world problems through technology, I
          enjoy learning new programming languages, building practical
          solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my academic journey, I've gained hands-on experience in
          Java, Python, C#, and SQL, and I've contributed to group assignments
          involving business operation simulations and database-driven
          applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm always eager to take on new challenges and continue growing as a
          developer. I'm currently seeking junior developer opportunities where
          I can apply my skills, learn from experience, and contribute
          meaningfully to a dynamic team.
